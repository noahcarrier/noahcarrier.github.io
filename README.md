# Portfolio Website

This repository utilizes GitHub pages to deploy a website at the URL noahcarrier.github.io

The site is built to serve as a portfolio for myself, Noah Carrier, to display technical skills in both the building of the site itself and other presented projects on site.



The site is organized under the following sections: 
 - Index page
    - entrance to website with "Enter" button
 - Home page
    - hub for navigating site at the menu bar and other displayed information such as "Featured Projects" and "Skills"
 - About page
    - page to display personal information about my background and academic history
 - Projects page
    - hub for accessing different individual project pages with descriptions, images, repo links, and download links
 - Contact page
    - page with information on how to reach out for employment or project requests



The site currently uses HTML & CSS to be built upon but intends to later implement more advanced page features using Javascript or other languages to utilizes functionalities to present technical skills. The site is kept up to date on an unformally regular basis as personally thought to be necessary.
