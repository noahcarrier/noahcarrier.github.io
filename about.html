                    This site aims to aid in colleagues and recuiters reviewing some of the skills I've accumulated from my time at UCF demonstrated through both the projects page and the design of this site. This site was built using the GitHub pages platform where I am able to utilize a Git repository to build the site on HTML & CSS from scratch. Feel free to view my projects as they are updated, and check out the Contact Page for methods to reach out.
