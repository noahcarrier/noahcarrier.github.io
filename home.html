                                Experience in managerial positions both in the classroom and in a workplace environment. Under an Entrepreneurship minor, I've had a helpful amount of instruction and practice in how to handle myself as a leader and communicate goals to teams of many different backgrounds.

                                My time in both the workplace and at the University of Central Florida has taught me to foster a collaborative attitude to problem solving. This includes, importantly, taking in diverse input that can be valuable to a solution. By both being passive in listening, and assertive through my own ideas, I have been greatly trained in group work.

                                My time in Computer Science and similar courses more than anything have taught me to tackle problems in new ways. Whether it relates to data structures & algorithms or a plug n' play approach to summation math problems, dynamic and critical thinking is important in my education. Knowing how to change my thought process based on what I'm solving for has become a keystone to my problem solving skills.
